1. **Clone the `.env.example` File**: Clone the `.env.example` file in the project directory and rename it to `.env`.

2. **Update Environment Variables**: Update the environment variables in the `.env` file according to your project requirements. Refer to the comments in the file for guidance.

   ```plaintext
   POSTGRES_URL="..."
   POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="..."
   POSTGRES_URL_NO_SSL="..."
   POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="..."
   POSTGRES_USER="..."
   POSTGRES_HOST="..."
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD="..."
   POSTGRES_DATABASE="..."

   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="..."
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY="..."

   UPLOADTHING_SECRET="..."
   UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="..."
